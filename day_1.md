# INTRODUCTION TO CYBER SECURITY 

# Day 1: Introduction to Cyber Security
Today marked the first day of my Cyber Security Foundation course, and I found it to be an eye-opening experience. We started with the fundamentals—understanding what cyber security actually means. I learned that cyber security is about protecting systems, networks and data from cyber threats such as unauthorized access, attacks, damage or theft. This field isn’t limited to just big companies, it applies to everyone—businesses, governments and individuals alike.

## Importance of Cyber Security
We also discussed the rising importance of cyber security in today’s world, where data is considered the new gold. With the digital transformation happening globally, everything from banking to healthcare is becoming more reliant on online systems. This, of course, opens up new vulnerabilities that attackers exploit for financial gain, espionage, or even sabotage. It became clear that cyber security is about more than just defending against hackers—it's about protecting the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data. 
Some of the importance are as follow:
1. Protects sensitive data – Guards personal, financial, and confidential information from unauthorized access.

2. Prevents financial loss – Reduces risks of fraud, data breaches, and cyber-attacks that can result in significant monetary damage.

3. Maintains privacy – Safeguards individuals' and organizations' privacy by preventing identity theft and data misuse.

4. Ensures business continuity – Minimizes downtime and disruptions caused by cyber-attacks, keeping operations running smoothly.

5. Safeguards reputation – Protects the organization's brand image by preventing data breaches and maintaining customer trust.

6. Regulatory compliance – Helps organizations meet legal and industry requirements for data protection.

7. Prevents malware and ransomware – Guards against malicious software that can compromise systems or hold data hostage.

8. Secures communication – Ensures the integrity of emails, messaging, and other forms of digital communication.

9. Defends against cyber threats – Protects networks from hacking, phishing, and other evolving cyber threats.

10. Enhances productivity – A secure network reduces disruptions and enhances employee efficiency.

## Today's Learning Summary:
The day ended with an introduction to the different domains of cyber security: network security, information security, application security and operational security. Each of these areas requires specialized knowledge which I hope to gain over the coming days. The idea that cyber security is as much about people and processes as it is about technology intrigued me, and I’m excited to learn more about the human factors involved.
