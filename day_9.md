# NETWORKING SECURITY FUNDAMENTALS 

# Day 9: Network Security Fundamentals
Today's session was all about network security fundamentals and it was packed with essential information. We started by discussing how networks are structured and the protocols that enable them to function. I learned about IP addresses, subnetting, and how devices communicate with each other over a network. Understanding the basics of networking is crucial because most cyber attacks happen over networks.

## Objective: 
To understand the fundamentals of network security, key concepts, common security measures, and how they help protect network infrastructure from cyber threats.

## 1. Introduction to Network Security
### Overview of Network Security:
Network security is crucial for protecting the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data as it moves across different network infrastructures. It involves both hardware and software measures designed to prevent unauthorized access, misuse, or attack on a network.

---

### Key Concepts:
1. The CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability):
- Confidentiality ensures that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized users.
- Integrity guarantees that data remains accurate and unaltered during transmission.
- Availability ensures that network resources are accessible when needed by authorized users.

2. Firewalls:
- Firewalls are the first line of defense in network security. They filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on a set of rules, allowing only legitimate traffic to pass while blocking malicious or unauthorized connections. There are hardware firewalls (external devices) and software firewalls (programs on computers).

3. Encryption:
Encryption is essential for protecting data in transit. It transforms data into a format that’s unreadable without the appropriate decryption key. Technologies like TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) are used to encrypt data, especially on websites (indicated by "https://" in URLs).

## 2. Security Mechanisms and Threats
### Common Network Attacks:
1. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):
- A DDoS attack floods the network with excessive traffic, overwhelming servers and rendering services unavailable to legitimate users. It often involves using multiple compromised systems (bots) to launch the attack.

2. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:
In a MitM attack, an attacker intercepts the communication between two parties, allowing them to read or alter messages. This can happen on unsecured networks, especially public Wi-Fi, and is often mitigated by encryption (e.g., using HTTPS).

3. Phishing:
Phishing involves tricking individuals into revealing sensitive information (such as login credentials or financial details) through fraudulent emails or websites. These fake websites often look very similar to legitimate ones, but their goal is to steal personal data.

## Security Tools:
1. VPN (Virtual Private Network):
- A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between a user’s device and the internet. This ensures that data sent over public networks (like Wi-Fi) is protected from interception or eavesdropping, making it a critical tool for securing remote work.

2. IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems):
- IDS is a system that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity or potential threats. When an intrusion is detected, it sends alerts to the network administrator.
- IPS goes a step further by actively preventing attacks, automatically blocking malicious traffic when it’s detected. These systems can be set up at various points in the network to protect sensitive data.

## Today's Learning Summary:
- Today’s session provided a solid foundation in the core principles of network security. I now understand the importance of protecting data through measures like firewalls, encryption, and secure network protocols.
I also learned about common network threats, including DDoS attacks, phishing, and man-in-the-middle attacks, and how security tools like VPNs and IDS/IPS systems help defend against these risks.
The concept of the CIA Triad was reinforced, helping me understand how confidentiality, integrity, and availability are critical in any network security strategy.
- I found particularly interesting was learning about packet filtering and how firewalls inspect data packets to allow or block traffic based on a set of security rules. We also touched on more advanced techniques like deep packet inspection, which examines the actual contents of the data being transmitted. Today’s session gave me a comprehensive understanding of how crucial network security is, especially in large organizations where multiple devices and users are connected to the same network.
