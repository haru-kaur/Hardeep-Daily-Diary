# CYBER THREATS AND ATTACKS

# Day 2: Introduction to Cyber Threats and Attacks
Today's session was all about the various cyber threats and attack methods that exist in the digital world. I was introduced to a variety of cyber threats each of which targets different aspects of a system. We covered malware, which can be further classified into viruses, worms, Trojans, and ransomware. Malware is essentially malicious software that can infect and damage a system without the user’s consent.

## Types of Cyber Attacks:

### 1. Malware
Malware is a broad category of malicious software designed to infiltrate and harm computer systems, networks, or devices. It includes a wide range of software, such as viruses, worms, Trojans, and spyware. These programs can steal sensitive information, corrupt files, destroy data, or take control of a device. Some malware can be used to create botnets, networks of infected computers controlled by attackers, which can be used for various malicious purposes, including launching DDoS attacks. Malware typically spreads through malicious email attachments, compromised websites, or infected software downloads. Its impact can be devastating, resulting in loss of data, financial loss, and significant system downtime.

### 2. Phishing
Phishing is a social engineering attack where cybercriminals impersonate legitimate institutions—such as banks, email providers, or even government bodies—to trick individuals into providing personal and sensitive information. These attacks typically come in the form of deceptive emails, text messages, or websites that look identical to trusted entities, but their purpose is to steal credentials, credit card numbers, or personal data. Phishing can also lead to further security breaches when attackers gain access to email accounts or corporate networks. Advanced phishing methods, like spear phishing, target specific individuals within an organization, often with highly personalized messages to increase the likelihood of success. The consequences can be severe, including identity theft, fraud, and unauthorized access to accounts or systems.

### 3. Ransomware
Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the victim’s files or locks them out of their systems and demands payment (ransom) for the decryption key or to regain access. Ransomware can spread through malicious email attachments, exploit kits, or compromised websites. Once the ransomware infects a system, it typically displays a ransom note, demanding payment in cryptocurrency, and warns the victim that failure to comply will result in the permanent loss of their data. Not only does ransomware cause operational disruption, but it can also result in significant financial costs if the ransom is paid or if data recovery efforts are expensive. In some cases, even paying the ransom doesn’t guarantee the recovery of data, as attackers may not provide the decryption keys or may release the data publicly, as seen in double extortion tactics.

### 4. Denial of Service (DoS)
Denial of Service (DoS) attacks aim to disrupt the normal functioning of a target by overwhelming its systems, network, or servers with excessive traffic, making the service unavailable to legitimate users. A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack amplifies the impact by using a network of compromised systems (a botnet) to flood the target with traffic. These attacks can paralyze websites, disrupt e-commerce platforms, or render cloud-based services inaccessible. The financial and reputational damage caused by a DDoS attack can be substantial, as businesses lose revenue during downtime and customers lose trust. DDoS attacks are often used as a distraction in more complex cyberattacks, or they are carried out by hacktivists or competitors aiming to disrupt a business.

### 5. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
In a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties without their knowledge. This can happen in unsecured networks, such as public Wi-Fi, where attackers can eavesdrop on data exchanged between a user and a website. MitM attacks allow cybercriminals to capture sensitive information like login credentials, credit card numbers, or private messages. In more advanced versions of MitM attacks, the attacker can also modify the content of the communication in real time, leading to data breaches or fraud. For example, an attacker may redirect a user to a fraudulent website or inject malicious code into a legitimate communication. Encryption protocols like TLS/SSL help mitigate this risk by securing data transmissions, but vulnerabilities in these protocols can still be exploited.

### 6. SQL Injection
SQL Injection is a code injection attack that exploits vulnerabilities in a website's database layer. It occurs when an attacker inserts malicious SQL queries into input fields on a website (such as a search box or login form) in an attempt to manipulate the database. This can allow attackers to retrieve, modify, or delete data stored in the database or even gain unauthorized access to an entire server. For example, they could steal user credentials, financial records, or other sensitive information. SQL Injection attacks exploit poorly coded websites that don’t properly validate or sanitize user input. They can cause massive data breaches and can even result in the complete compromise of a website's backend systems.

### 7. Zero-Day Exploit
A Zero-Day Exploit is an attack that takes advantage of a software vulnerability that the vendor or developer is unaware of and has not yet patched. Since the software maker has "zero days" to fix the vulnerability, the attack can occur without any immediate defense or mitigation. Zero-day exploits are highly valuable to cybercriminals and hackers because they target weaknesses in systems that have not been publicly disclosed, making them difficult to defend against. Once discovered, vendors usually rush to release security patches, but until that happens, the vulnerability remains open for attackers to exploit. Zero-day exploits are often used in targeted attacks, such as espionage or data breaches, and can affect operating systems, browsers, and applications.

### 8. Brute Force Attack
A Brute Force Attack is a method used to crack passwords or encryption by systematically trying every possible combination until the correct one is found. These attacks can be automated using specialized software, allowing attackers to try millions or even billions of password combinations in a short time. While this type of attack is often used to break into user accounts, it can also be used to decipher encrypted data. Brute force attacks are often successful against weak or simple passwords, such as "123456" or "password." To defend against this type of attack, systems should implement account lockouts after a certain number of incorrect attempts, use multi-factor authentication (MFA), and ensure users create strong, complex passwords.

### 9. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into trusted websites, which then execute when users interact with those sites. These scripts can steal sensitive information, such as cookies or session tokens, allowing attackers to impersonate users or access their private accounts. There are three main types of XSS attacks: Stored XSS, where the malicious script is saved on the server and executed when a user loads a page; Reflected XSS, where the malicious script is immediately executed via a URL or user input; and DOM-based XSS, where the malicious script is executed by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) of a webpage. XSS attacks can lead to data theft, account compromise, and the spread of malware.

### 10. Insider Threats
Insider Threats involve malicious or negligent actions by employees, contractors, or trusted individuals within an organization. These individuals may intentionally steal data, sabotage systems, or leak sensitive information, or they may inadvertently expose data by falling victim to phishing attacks or by misusing their access privileges. Insider threats can be difficult to detect because they often involve people who have legitimate access to systems and data. The damage caused by insider threats can be as severe as external attacks, potentially leading to financial loss, legal liabilities, or reputational damage. To mitigate insider threats, organizations must implement strict access controls, monitor user behavior, and regularly review permissions and audit logs.

- Each of these attacks poses unique challenges to organizations and individuals, highlighting the need for comprehensive cybersecurity strategies, including encryption, regular software updates, employee training, and robust access controls.

## Today's Learning Summary:
Understanding these various forms of attacks made me realize how proactive one must be in the field of cyber security. You can never let your guard down, as attackers are constantly evolving their tactics. The day ended with a brief introduction to common defense mechanisms, such as firewalls and antivirus software, but we were told that no single solution is sufficient—layered security is key.
