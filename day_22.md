# Day 22: Review and Future Learning
- Today marked the final day of the training program, and it was a day of reflection and review. We revisited the key concepts covered over the past 20 days, from network security fundamentals to cloud security. Each topic built on the previous one, providing me with a well-rounded understanding of the different areas of cybersecurity.
- We discussed the importance of continuous learning in the field of cybersecurity. Threats are constantly evolving, and new vulnerabilities and attack vectors are discovered regularly. As a result, cybersecurity professionals must stay up to date with the latest developments, whether through certifications, industry conferences or online resources.

## Objective:
To review the key concepts and skills learned during the training period and outline the next steps for continued learning in cybersecurity.

## Review of Key Learnings
- Over the past few days, I have covered a wide range of topics essential for building a strong foundation in cybersecurity.
- Hereâ€™s a summary of some of the key concepts:

1. Cryptography: Learned the basics of encryption and decryption, understanding how data is securely transmitted and stored.

2. Authentication & Authorization: Gained knowledge on how authentication mechanisms verify user identities, and how authorization ensures access control to resources.

3. Incident Response and Handling: Explored the process of handling security incidents, from detection to recovery, and the importance of an organized incident response plan.

4. SOC (Security Operations Centre): Understood the role and functions of a SOC in monitoring, detecting, and responding to cybersecurity threats.

5. Cloud Security: Learned about securing cloud environments, including best practices like encryption, access control, and the shared responsibility model between cloud providers and customers.

6. Password Management: Studied the importance of strong password practices, tools like password managers, and advanced security techniques such as multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## Challenges Encountered
- While the training provided a comprehensive overview of cybersecurity, some challenges I encountered include:
1. Complexity of Cloud Security: The shared responsibility model and securing cloud environments with proper IAM (Identity and Access Management) can be complex.

2. Understanding SOC Tools: Some of the advanced tools like SIEM and CASBs require further hands-on practice to fully grasp their functionality.

3. Incident Response Strategy: Crafting an effective incident response plan is more challenging when considering the variety of incidents that can occur in a real-world scenario.

## Future Learning Goals
- As I continue to develop my expertise in cybersecurity, here are the areas I aim to focus on:
1. Advanced Cryptography: I have to Dive deeper into encryption algorithms and learn about asymmetric encryption, digital signatures and key management.

2. Threat Intelligence & Penetration Testing: I have to learn more about identifying vulnerabilities and using penetration testing tools to simulate attacks and improve defenses.

3. Advanced Cloud Security: I have to gain deeper knowledge of cloud infrastructure security, especially with regard to hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Focus on practical skills in managing cloud security tools like AWS CloudTrail, Azure Security Center, and Google Cloud Security Command Center.

4. SOC Operations: I need to explore advanced SOC roles, and get hands-on practice with tools like Splunk, Elasticsearch, and other SIEM solutions. I plan to simulate real-time threat monitoring and incident response within a SOC environment.
Automation and Scripting: Learn how to automate security tasks using scripts, especially for incident detection, alerting, and response. Learning Python or PowerShell for security automation would be beneficial.

## Today's Learning Summary:
- During this training, I gained a solid understanding of key cybersecurity concepts. 
- I learned about **Cryptography**, including encryption and hashing for securing data and explored **Authentication** and **Authorization** methods to protect access to resources.
- I developed skills in **Incident Response**, focusing on how to detect, manage, and recover from security incidents.
- I also learned the importance of **Security Operations Centres (SOCs)** for monitoring and responding to threats using tools like SIEM and CASBs. 
- In addition, I studied **Cloud security** understanding the shared responsibility model and best practices for securing cloud environments.
- Overall, this training has provided me with both theoretical knowledge and hands-on skills essential for safeguarding systems against cyber threats.
